# Description: a log of the process

*02/27/2025:*
- I have been doing this project for a week now.
- I had to put it off for a day or so, but have started to get somewhere into the process of building my inverse function
- This requires me to break down the matrix into L&U in order to push them into row-echelon form and solve 
- Right now I am in the process of finding the pivot values and determining whether elimination needs to be performed on that column before continuing

*03/12/2025:*
- I have left this project for a while now (about 2-3 weeks)... I'm now forcing myself to write this at 9:48PM on a Wednesday night.
- This project will go on. I will not be deterred.
- This probably reads like something out of a sci-fi horror game where you find the scientist's log, but its not that deep, LA is just hard
---
- Ok so i worked on this for an hour and made a little progress on LU Decomp.
- Check the C++ Notes for %d vs %f for formatting when doing int division. Also printf vs cout for structured output formatting.
- We were able to get to the point right before assigning the values into the L matrix, but we did calculate all of them for the first column correctly
- we've got the right idea, but something is wrong

Next steps:
- finish elimination step.
- test and evaluate.
