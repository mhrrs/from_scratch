# Description: a log of the process

*02/27/2025:*
- I have been doing this project for a week now.
- I had to put it off for a day or so, but have started to get somewhere into the process of building my inverse function
- This requires me to break down the matrix into L&U in order to push them into row-echelon form and solve 
- Right now I am in the process of finding the pivot values and determining whether elimination needs to be performed on that column before continuing

Next steps:
- finish elimination step.
- test and evaluate.
