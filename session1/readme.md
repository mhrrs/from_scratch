# Session One: Regression Algorithms

*Idea:*
> Create multi-threaded program that can process the seperate regressions below in parralel.

- [done] create hello world
- Start from the bottom and work are way up
- create make file as well
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Alternating minimization?


*What is success in this project?*
- we can successfully implement all items without chatgpt
- we learn about: templates, operator overloading, memory allocation, threading, concurrency, parralellism
