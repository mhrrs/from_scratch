# Description: This is an attempt at documenting my progress through this from_scratch journey

*Key things to note:*
- all columns will be stored on a by-column basis in one single vector.
- - this speeds up computation and saves on space because I can have one vector containing a bunch of floats, not a vector that contains vectors.
