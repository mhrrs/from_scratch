# Description: This repo is a project to build my ability to code things from zero knowledge with no LLM usage.

**Why?:**
- I've become dependent on using LLMs for quick fixes and have lost knowledge over the smaller details
- - C++
- - memory management
- I desire a challenge and the ability to confidently implement something end-to-end

**What Kind of Projects To Expect:**
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Art Design (like continuation of my spectral design app)
- Physics Sims


# Session 1:
- basic ML algos
- parallelism
- multi-threading/mutex/race conditions
- templates
- operator overloading
- memory allocation
- smart pointers
